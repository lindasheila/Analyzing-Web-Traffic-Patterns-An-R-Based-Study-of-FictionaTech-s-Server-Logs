# Analyzing-Web-Traffic-Patterns-An-R-Based-Study-of-FictionaTech-s-Server-Logs
This project analyzes FictionaTech's web server logs to uncover statistical insights, correlations, and patterns in user behavior and web traffic. Using R programming, I clean, explore, and visualize the dataset, providing actionable recommendations to optimize web services. The deliverable is an R Markdown file containing the code and analysis.

Project Description:
This project aims to analyze web server log data from FictionaTech, a technology company that provides innovative web-based services. By analyzing user interactions and web page access patterns, the project seeks to identify areas for improving web performance, optimizing content delivery, and enhancing overall user experience.
Key Objectives:

    Data Exploration: Gain insights into the dataset, including timestamps, HTTP methods, status codes, URLs, user agents, referrers, bytes transferred, and server response times.

    Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, address duplicate records, and ensure the dataset is clean and consistent for analysis.

    Data Analysis: Perform an in-depth analysis, including counting the frequency of accessed URLs, analyzing server response times, and identifying traffic patterns based on different criteria like HTTP status codes and user agents.

    Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations to optimize FictionaTech's web services and improve the digital experience for users.

Research Questions:

The project answers several key questions, such as:

    What are the most frequently accessed web pages?

    How often do HTTP status codes such as '404 Not Found' occur?

    What pages have server response times exceeding 100 milliseconds?

    How does user-agent data, such as "Safari 15.0," impact the access patterns?

    What are the traffic patterns for specific dates and pages (e.g., '/products.html')?

    What are the distribution trends for bytes transferred and server response times?

Tools and Techniques:

    R Programming: Utilizing libraries like dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for visualization, and other essential R packages for statistical analysis.

    R Markdown: The solution is implemented in an R Markdown file, which integrates both code and analysis to provide a comprehensive report.
